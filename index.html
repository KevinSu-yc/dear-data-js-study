        <h3><u>Question I'm Exploring</u></h3>
        <p>While creating this plot, I'm trying to explore:
            <b>
                As I am familiar with more English words, how will my searching habit affect my test scores on Quizlet?
            </b>
        </p>

        <h3><u>Data I Used For This Visualization</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Date of every observation:</b> The X axis value of this plot. I started to collect my data everyday
                since October 18th until December 15th. However I only started taking two tests every day after
                October 23rd so I didn't show the data before on my final visualization.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Amount of noted new English words each day</b>: When I read or hear a word that I don't know the
                meaning, I will record the word. At the end of each day, I will have a list of noted English words.
                This is shown by the radius of the blue circle in this plot.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Amount of searches I made each day and how many of them are in English</b>: I'll record every
                searches I made on different search platform (Google, YouTube, Amazon, etc.) so I can calculate the
                percentage of English searched I made each day. This is shown by the pink area in this graph
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Test scores on Quizlet</b>: Quizlet is a learning app
                (<a href="https://quizlet.com/">See official website of Quizlet</a>)
                that provide a function to create tests based on
                the words noted by the users. The scores I get on the tests can
                <b>indicate how well I'm learning new English words.</b>
                At the end of each day, I will take a test based on the words noted on that day.
                In addition, to see if I'm really memorizing the words, I will take another test based on the same list
                of words on the next day. This is shoen by the Y axis value of the circles.

            <li><a href="term_project_data_table.pdf">See table of my collected data</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3><u>Choosing the Type of My Visualization</u></h3>
        <p>
            For this visualization, I'm trying to create a graph that's <b>similar to a cleveland dot plot</b>
            that draws pairs of circles linked by lines. (Cleveland dot plot was mentioned in previous classes and there
            was an example provided in the example_cleveland_dot_plot file from class 9 materials.)
            However, to fit the data I am collecting, I made some adjustment in my plot.
            Since I wanted to see how well I am learning the new English words I noted everyday, I'm not only taking
            tests at the end of everyday but also taking tests about the same list of words on the next day. By using
            the concept of cleveland dot plot, I can
            <b>observe the changes between the scores of two tests I take for the same words on different days.</b>
            I think cleveland dot plot suits well for my data when reviewing it so I tried
            to implement it to this visualization.
        </p>

        <p>
            The other kind of graph I used in my visualization was <b>area graph</b> I learned from:
            <a
                href="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/area_graph.html">https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/area_graph.html</a>.
            It's a simpler version of stacked area graph mentioned in class but I only used area graph just to see how
            the percentage of English searches I made changes day by day. I wanted to see the relationship between my
            searching habit and my test scores on Quizlet, so I add the area graph about the percentage of English
            searches I made every day as a background of this visualization.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Adding Interacitve Design to My Visualization</u></h3>
        <p>
            Following the suggestions I got from Jay and my classmates in class, I tried to add options to this
            visualization.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    By selecting the date range, the users can choose to see which part of my data so the
                    circles won't be clustered as the plot for every day.
                </li>
                <li>
                    By checking the box for the scores on the next
                    day, the users can see the green circles and the lines that connecting every pair of circles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    By checking the box for percentage of English searches, the users can see the area graph showing the
                    change of my searching habit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    By checking the box for different lines, the users can see the blue and red lines then see the
                    relationships between them.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Also, I tried to add vertical lines to help users to see which date the circles are refer to when they move
            the mouse onto the circles, but there are already a lot of lines in my plot so I didn't add the vertical
            lines at last.
        </p>

        <h3><u>My Observations For This Visualization</u></h3>
        <p>
            By observing this visualization, I can see that most of the red lines connecting the cicles (represent
            decreasing scores) are matching the red lines on the area graph (represent decreasing percentage of
            English searches) and most of the blue lines are matching as well. Thus I find out that this plot is giving
            the idea of:
            <b>
                when the percentage of English searches I made increases on the next day, my scores on Quizlet are more
                likely
                to improve or remain the same on the next day.
            </b>
            By choosing which kind of lines to show on the plot using the provided checkboxes, the relationships can be
            easier to see.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition,
            <b>I assume the amount of tested words is also a factor that affects my test scores,</b>
            so the larger
            circles should fall on lower positions. According to this plot it quite support my expectation, I can
            see most of the smaller circles fall on the top of this plot. That means
            I can learn better when the amount of noted words are under a certain number. By hiding the area graph of
            percentage of English searches and the test scores on the next day using the check box,
            I can focus more on the difference of the blue circles to see this relationship.
