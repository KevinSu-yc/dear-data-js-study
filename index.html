                This was a school project I did for the course 'Programming Foundation'
                at Northeastern University CPS Digital Media Program.

            <p class="mb-small">
                The project is inspired by Dear Data which explore the data related to my
                everyday life and try visualizing it through front-end programming. I chose
                to observe as I'm more familiar with using English, will my searching habit
                be different.

                        October 23rd so I didn't show the data before on my final visualization.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="text-bold">* Amount of noted new English words each day</span>: When I read or hear a word that I don't know the
                    meaning, I will record the word. At the end of each day, I will have a list of noted English words.
                    This is shown by the radius of the blue circle in this plot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="text-bold">* Amount of searches I made each day and how many of them are in English</span>: I'll record every
                    searches I made on different search platform (Google, YouTube, Amazon, etc.) so I can calculate the
                    percentage of English searched I made each day. This is shown by the pink area in this graph

                    Choosing the Type of My Visualization
                </h3>
                <p>
                    For this visualization, I'm trying to create a graph that's <b>similar to a cleveland dot plot</b>
                    that draws pairs of circles linked by lines. (Cleveland dot plot was mentioned in previous classes and there
                    was an example provided in the example_cleveland_dot_plot file from class 9 materials.)
                    However, to fit the data I am collecting, I made some adjustment in my plot.
                    Since I wanted to see how well I am learning the new English words I noted everyday, I'm not only taking
                    tests at the end of everyday but also taking tests about the same list of words on the next day. By using
                    the concept of cleveland dot plot, I can
                    <span class="text-bold">observe the changes between the scores of two tests I take for the same words on different days.</span>
                    I think cleveland dot plot suits well for my data when reviewing it so I tried
                    to implement it to this visualization.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-small">
                    The other kind of graph I used in my visualization was <span class="text-bold">area graph</span> I learned from:
                    <a href="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/area_graph.html" class="text-blue">https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/area_graph.html</a>.
                    It's a simpler version of stacked area graph mentioned in class but I only used area graph just to see how
                    the percentage of English searches I made changes day by day. I wanted to see the relationship between my
                    searching habit and my test scores on Quizlet, so I add the area graph about the percentage of English
                    searches I made every day as a background of this visualization.

                    Adding Interacitve Design to My Visualization
                </h3>
                
                <p>
                    Following the suggestions I got from Jay and my classmates in class, I tried to add options to this
                    visualization.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="text-bold">* By selecting the date range</span>, the users can choose to see which part of my data so the
                    circles won't be clustered as the plot for every day.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="text-bold">* By checking the box for the scores on the next
                    day</span>, the users can see the green circles and the lines that connecting every pair of circles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="text-bold">* By checking the box for percentage of English searches</span>, the users can see the area graph showing the
                    change of my searching habit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="text-bold">*By checking the box for different lines</span>, the users can see the blue and red lines then see the
                    relationships between them.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-small">
                    Also, I tried to add vertical lines to help users to see which date the circles are refer to when they move
                    the mouse onto the circles, but there are already a lot of lines in my plot so I didn't add the vertical
                    lines at last.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-blue mb-paragraph">My Observations For This Visualization</h3>
                <p>
                    By observing this visualization, I can see that most of the red lines connecting the cicles (represent
                    decreasing scores) are matching the red lines on the area graph (represent decreasing percentage of
                    English searches) and most of the blue lines are matching as well. Thus I find out that this plot is giving
                    the idea of:
                    <span class="text-bold">
                        when the percentage of English searches I made increases on the next day, my scores on Quizlet are more
                        likely
                        to improve or remain the same on the next day.
                    </span>
                    By choosing which kind of lines to show on the plot using the provided checkboxes, the relationships can be
                    easier to see.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-small">
                    In addition,
                    <span class="text-bold">I assume the amount of tested words is also a factor that affects my test scores,</span>
                    so the larger
                    circles should fall on lower positions. According to this plot it quite support my expectation, I can
                    see most of the smaller circles fall on the top of this plot. That means
                    I can learn better when the amount of noted words are under a certain number. By hiding the area graph of
