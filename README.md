# Analyzing the Impact of English Learning on Search Habits

## Introduction

This project was developed as a part of the "Programming Foundation" course at Northeastern University CPS Digital Media Program. Inspired by the concept of "Dear Data," which explores visualizing data related to my everyday life, this project explores the relationship between my search habits and English learning progress.
